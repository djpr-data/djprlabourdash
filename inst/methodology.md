# DJPR Jobs Dashboard Data Methodology

## Introduction

The DJPR Jobs Dashboard includes detailed labour market activity data compiled and released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and the National Skills Commission. Attributions under respective charts will specify the time period of the data (i.e. whether it is produced on a monthly, or quarterly), as well as whether it is original (raw) data, seasonally adjusted, 3-month or 12-month rolling average.

## The Monthly Labour Force Survey (LFS)

The monthly Labour Force Survey (LFS) provides information about the labour market activity of Australia's resident civilian population aged 15 years and over. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has been publishing monthly labour market data since February 1978. The LFS is designed to provide estimates of employment and unemployment for Australia, for each state and territory. 

Data from the monthly Labour Force Survey are released in two stages:

- The initial release is [Labour Force Australia](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/employment-and-unemployment/labour-force-australia/latest-release),  which includes headline estimates of employment, unemployment, underemployment, participation and hours worked for Australia, and the states and territories. This is usually published 39 days after the beginning of interviews for that month, which is the third Thursday of the month following the reference month (e.g. estimates for March are published on the third Thursday in April). The exception is December, where estimates are published 46 days after.

- The second release is [Labour Force, Australia, Detailed](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/employment-and-unemployment/labour-force-australia-detailed/latest-release), which includes more detailed monthly and quarterly data. The quarterly detailed data was previously published separately, in Labour Force, Australia, Detailed, Quarterly. The second release occurs 7 days after the first release (i.e. the fourth Thursday of the month).
